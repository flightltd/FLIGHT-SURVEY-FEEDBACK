# FLIGHT SURVEY 

FLIGHT SURVEY's browser and mobile applications help you to plan and share missions through the identification of airspace and ground hazards. It allows you to add unlimited custom mark-up, operational notes, create a risk assessment and combine it all into a formatted PDF flight plan with your own branding.

You can either search for the location and draw your mission area or create it from KML. The app can be installed on unlimited devices (Android and iOS) and it allows you to take your missions offline and easily export the results to DroneDeploy, Pix4Capture, Google Earth and Sat Nav apps.
